when, in the course of human events, it becomes necessry for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's god entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the  causes which impel them to the separation.  we hold these truths to  be self-evident, that  all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these  are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the  people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and  organizing its powers  in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.  prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath  shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. but when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to  reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their  duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. such has been the  patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity  which constrains them  to alter their former systems of government.  the history of the present king of great-britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these  states. to prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.  ... we, therefore,  the representatives of the united states of america, in general congress, assembled, appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name,and by authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these united colonies are, and of right, ought to be, free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown, and  that all political connection between them and the state of great-britain is and ought to be  totally dissolved:  and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce,  and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. and for the  support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.
